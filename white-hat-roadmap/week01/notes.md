# CS50 Week 0 - Computational Thinking

### Key Concepts Introduced

### Computer Science = Problem Solving
- Not just about coding â€” it's about thinking logically and methodically.
- The goal is to break down complex problems into simpler, solvable steps.

### Algorithms
- A step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem.
- Example: Making a peanut butter & jelly sandwich â€” if steps are unclear or skipped, it fails.

### Precise Instructions
- Computers are literal â€” they follow instructions exactly.
- You must be clear, detailed, and ordered in your commands.

### Abstraction
- Hiding unnecessary details to focus on the core problem.
- Example: Using a light switch without needing to understand how electricity works.

### Input / Output / Storage / Processing
- Core components of a computer system:
  - **Input** â€“ Data that comes in (keyboard, mouse)
  - **Processing** â€“ Operations performed on the data
  - **Storage** â€“ Saving information (memory, drives)
  - **Output** â€“ Results shown (monitor, printer)

## ðŸ’¬ Takeaways
- Computers are powerful tools, but the real power is in how we instruct them.
- Algorithms are like recipes â€” simple, repeatable steps matter more than clever tricks.
- Abstraction helps reduce mental load so we can focus only on whatâ€™s important.
- You already use computational thinking in everyday life â€” this course helps you apply it with code.
