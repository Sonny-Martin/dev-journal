Dev Journal

This repository contains my journey into software development. As a beginner, I am documenting and sharing my learning process, projects, and tasks along the way. My goal is to build a strong foundation in programming, with a focus on Python and eventually expanding into AI and software development.

Projects & Tasks

Python Practice: A collection of small Python scripts and tasks to practice core programming concepts.
Task-Based Projects: Progressing from simple exercises to more complex applications, including calculators and conditionals.
Learning Path: Continually improving my skills with hands-on experience and contributing to open-source projects.
Next Steps

Continue expanding knowledge of Python and explore more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.
Start learning about machine learning, AI, and software development frameworks.
Contribute to projects and collaborate with others to gain real-world experience.
Feel free to follow my progress, suggest improvements, or contribute to the projects!
