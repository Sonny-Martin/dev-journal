# Sonny’s Dev Journal

Hey there — I’m Sonny, and this repo is where I’m learning the ropes of coding and cybersecurity from the ground up.

Right now, I’m focusing on getting really solid with Python basics while also diving into the world of white hat hacking and ethical cybersecurity. Eventually, I want to combine both skills to build real, secure apps — and land a job where I can actually use what I’ve learned.

---

## What I’m Working On

- Writing Python scripts to learn how real code works (not just tutorials)
- Breaking down conditionals, functions, logic — and making sure I actually understand them
- Practicing writing clean, commented code so I can look back and remember *why* I did things
- Building a path toward software development *and* ethical hacking (yeah, both)

---

## What’s in Here

- `functions_challenges.py` – little problem-solving tasks with logic and math
- `functions_practice.py` – warmups like greetings, converting Celsius, checking odds/evens
- `conditionals_practice.py` – some beginner if/else code based on user input
- More stuff coming as I level up

---

## What’s Next

- Keep showing up and writing code daily
- Learn more about cybersecurity and how it ties into real software
- Start building small, useful projects to test both dev and security skills
- Stay consistent and keep everything logged here for the long haul

## Why This Exists

I wanted a place where I could track my progress and see how far I’ve come. If you’re just starting out too, feel free to follow along, fork this, or just lurk. No pressure — we’re all figuring it out.
